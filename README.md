## Import Method
This library is provided as a UnityPackage. Download the latest `.unitypackage` file from [the release page](https://github.com/MidraLab/uni-master-liker/releases) and import it into your project.

## How to Use
1. Copy Master Data for Google Sheet from [MasterSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KezPMdD_5XwFlmQP_AXGpJaX7qSl1HaiPVhfu0qiP48/edit?usp=sharing) to your Google Drive.

private static async void UpdateAPIClassFile()
{
    // Add implementation here
}
```
